# Description of Enigma_Installer commands.
# Set the value in section [parameter] to 1 to switch a parameter on. Set to 0 to switch it off
#
# partition:    0 does not partition the disc, i.e. this will leave your recordings intact
#               1 partitions the harddisc, i.e. all recordings will be lost
#               Info: If you install Enigma the first time you have to use 1 here
#
# createmini:   This setting will only have effect in combination with partition=1
#               0 only creates system partition, swap partition and record partition
#               1 additionally creates 4 partitions MINI1 to MINI4 at the end of the disk
#
# keepsettings: 0 does not copy any settings from the old system to the new installation
#               1 this will copy several configuration files from the disk into
#                 the file "e2settings/backup.tar.gz" of your stick. After the root file system
#                 has been installed, these files will be copied back onto the hdd.
#                 Info: If the file "e2settings/backup" already exists, this file
#                       will be used to restore the settings. Delete it before installation 
#                       to create a new backup file.
#               Info: If you install Enigma the first time you have to use 0 here
#
# keepbootargs: 0 updates the mtd2 flash with the default settings (bootargs, ip, gw)
#               1 does not update the mtd2 flash with the default settings, i.e. keep bootargs, ip, gw
#               Info: If you install Enigma the first time you have to use 0 here
#
# Advanced Settings:
# ==================
#
# usejfs:       1 Will use JFS instead of EXT2 for the RECORD partition.
#               This parameter will only take effect if partition is set to 1
#
# useext2e2:	1 will use EXT2 instead of EXT3 for the E2 partition and the MINI partitions. May be useful if hdd standby does not work properly
#               This parameter will only take effect if format is set to 1
#
# usbhdd:       0 performs normal installation onto the first partition of the internal hdd
#               1 will install Enigma2 to a USB HDD. Detach the USB stick
#                 when requested and attach a USB HDD.
#
# format:       0 does not partition or format the hdd. This will leave your recordings
#                 and all your files on the system partition intact.
#               1 Format the system partition of the hdd. 
#               Info: This parameter should always be set to 1 unless you have a very special reason!
#
# update:       0 Do not install the root file system. This just makes sense in combination with no_format.
#               1 Do install the root file system
#               Info: This parameter should always be set to 1 unless you have a very special reason!
